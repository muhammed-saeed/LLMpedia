The inaugural ceremony honored films from the previous year and has since evolved into a major event in the awards season calendar. Over the years, the Golden Globes have adapted to changes in the industry, including the introduction of new categories and the inclusion of television awards in 1956. The awards have been broadcast on television since 1963, gaining significant viewership and popularity.\n\n== Categories ==\n\nThe Golden Globe Awards feature a diverse array of categories that cover various genres and formats. Notably, the awards are divided into two main sections: film and television. In the film category, awards are given for Best Motion Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress, among others. In television, categories include Best Television Series, Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television, and acting awards for both drama and comedy series. The inclusion of both drama and comedy categories allows for a broader recognition of talent, including shows like [[The Big Bang Theory (TV series)]], which has been nominated for and won several Golden Globe Awards.\n\n== Impact on Careers ==\n\nWinning or even being nominated for a Golden Globe can significantly impact an individual's career in the entertainment industry. For actors, directors, and writers, a Golden Globe nomination is often seen as a mark of prestige and can lead to increased visibility and more significant opportunities. For example, [[Jim Parsons]], who starred in [[The Big Bang Theory (TV series)]], won multiple Golden Globe nominations for his portrayal of Sheldon Cooper, which helped solidify his status as a leading actor in television. The awards can also influence the success of films and television shows, often boosting box office sales and viewership ratings.\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nDespite its prestigious reputation, the Golden Globe Awards have faced various controversies over the years. Issues such as the lack of diversity among HFPA members and the transparency of the voting process have sparked discussions about the integrity of the awards. In recent years, the organization has made efforts to address these concerns, including expanding its membership and implementing new guidelines for nominations and voting. The controversies surrounding the awards highlight the ongoing challenges of representation in the entertainment industry.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Awards established in 1944]]\n[[Category:Golden Globe Awards]]\n[[Category:Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]", "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "overall_confidence": null, "links_from_markup": ["Golden Globe Award", "Hollywood Foreign Press Association", "Academy Awards", "The Big Bang Theory (TV series)", "Jim Parsons"], "categories_from_markup": ["Awards established in 1944", "Golden Globe Awards", "Hollywood Foreign Press Association"], "categories_from_meta": [], "ner_candidates": ["Golden Globe Award\n", "Hollywood Foreign Press Association\n", "Academy Awards\n", "The Big Bang Theory (TV series)\n", "Jim Parsons\n", "Awards established in 1944\n", "Golden Globe Awards\n"], "ner_next_subjects": []}

This decade saw the rise of diverse storytelling, with shows addressing contemporary social issues, evolving family dynamics, and the impact of technology on relationships. Among the most notable series was [[The Big Bang Theory]], which not only dominated the ratings but also influenced the landscape of sitcoms during this period.\n\n== Major Trends ==\n\nOne of the defining trends of 2010s sitcoms was the increasing emphasis on character-driven narratives. Shows like [[Parks and Recreation]] and [[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]] showcased ensemble casts with rich character development, allowing for deeper emotional connections with audiences. This shift was in part a response to the success of earlier series like [[Friends]], which had set a high bar for character interactions and chemistry. Additionally, the use of serialized storytelling became more common, with shows like [[The Good Place]] and [[Crazy Ex-Girlfriend]] incorporating overarching plots that encouraged viewers to tune in weekly.\n\nAnother significant trend was the incorporation of social commentary and representation of diverse voices. Sitcoms such as [[Black-ish]] and [[One Day at a Time]] tackled issues of race, identity, and cultural heritage, providing a platform for underrepresented perspectives. This movement towards inclusivity was mirrored in the success of shows featuring LGBTQ+ characters, such as [[Schitt's Creek]], which received critical acclaim for its positive representation and humor.\n\n== Notable Sitcoms ==\n\nSeveral sitcoms emerged as cultural touchstones during the 2010s.

Its blend of nerd culture, romance, and humor resonated with a broad audience, leading to a successful spin-off, [[Young Sheldon]], which explored the childhood of one of its main characters.\n\nOther notable sitcoms included [[How I Met Your Mother]], which concluded in 2014, and [[New Girl]], both of which contributed to the decade's comedic landscape. [[Modern Family]], a groundbreaking series that showcased a diverse range of family structures, continued to garner acclaim and awards throughout the decade, influencing the direction of family-oriented sitcoms.\n\n== Streaming and the Future of Sitcoms ==\n\nThe rise of streaming platforms like [[Netflix]] and [[Hulu]] changed the way sitcoms were produced and consumed. Shows like [[Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt]] and [[The Good Place]] found success on these platforms, allowing for more experimental storytelling and shorter seasons. This shift also encouraged the revival of classic sitcoms, with reboots and spin-offs becoming increasingly popular, as seen with [[Will & Grace]] and [[Fuller House]].\n\nAs the 2010s came to a close, the landscape of American sitcoms was evolving, with a focus on inclusivity and innovative formats. The influence of popular shows like [[The Big Bang Theory]] continued to shape the genre, paving the way for new voices and stories in the years to come.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2010s American television series]]\n[[Category:American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:Television series by genre]]", "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "overall_confidence": null, "links_from_markup": ["The Big Bang Theory", "Parks and Recreation", "Brooklyn Nine-Nine", "Friends", "The Good Place", "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend", "Black-ish", "One Day at a Time", "Schitt's Creek", "Young Sheldon", "How I Met Your Mother", "New Girl", "Modern Family", "Netflix", "Hulu", "Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt", "Will & Grace", "Fuller House"], "categories_from_markup": ["2010s American television series", "American sitcoms", "Television series by genre"], "categories_from_meta": [], "ner_candidates": ["The Big Bang Theory\n", "Parks and Recreation\n", "Brooklyn Nine-Nine\n", "Friends\n", "The Good Place\n", "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\n", "Black-ish\n", "One Day at a Time\n", "Schitt's Creek\n", "Young Sheldon\n", "How I Met Your Mother\n", "New Girl\n", "Modern Family\n", "Netflix\n", "Hulu\n", "Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\n", "Will & Grace\n", "Fuller House\n", "2010s American television series\n", "American sitcoms\n", "Television series by genre\n"], "ner_next_subjects": []}
