{"subject": "Television miniseries", "hop": 7, "wikitext": "'''Television miniseries''' are a form of television program that typically consists of a limited number of episodes, often ranging from two to ten, which are aired over a short period. They are designed to tell a complete story within their limited runtime, often adapting novels, historical events, or original screenplays. The format allows for more in-depth storytelling compared to traditional episodic television series, as the narrative can be more focused and character development more pronounced.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nTelevision miniseries are characterized by their finite length and self-contained narratives. Unlike regular television series that can run for multiple seasons, miniseries are intended to be completed within a single viewing cycle. This structure allows for a more cohesive storytelling experience, often culminating in a definitive conclusion. The production values of miniseries can be quite high, as they often attract notable actors and directors, similar to feature films. For example, the miniseries [[The Stand (0.92)]] based on the novel by [[Stephen King (0.95)]] showcases high production values and a star-studded cast.\n\n== Notable Examples ==\n\nSeveral notable miniseries have gained critical acclaim and popularity over the years. One such example is [[Roots (0.95)]], which aired in 1977 and depicted the history of an African American family from slavery to freedom.

The miniseries format has also been utilized to adapt works of literature, such as [[Pillars of the Earth (0.85)]] based on the novel by [[Ken Follett (0.85)]]. \n\nIn the context of comedy, the miniseries format has been used to explore themes and narratives in a condensed manner, allowing for character-driven stories similar to those found in traditional sitcoms like [[The Big Bang Theory (0.95)]]. While not a miniseries itself, the show's success demonstrates how character arcs can be effectively developed over multiple episodes, a technique often mirrored in miniseries storytelling.\n\n== Impact on Television ==\n\nThe rise of streaming platforms has led to a resurgence in the popularity of miniseries. Services like [[Netflix (0.95)]] and [[Hulu (0.85)]] have invested heavily in original miniseries, recognizing the format's appeal to audiences looking for complete stories without the commitment of a long-running series. This shift reflects changing viewing habits and the demand for high-quality, binge-worthy content. \n\nMiniseries also provide opportunities for filmmakers and writers to explore complex narratives that may not fit into the traditional episodic format. This flexibility has encouraged creative storytelling and innovation within the television landscape. The success of miniseries has led to a broader acceptance of diverse genres and narratives, further enriching the television medium.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Television miniseries]]\n[[Category:Television genres]]\n[[Category:Television series]]", "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "overall_confidence": null, "links_from_markup": ["The Stand (0.92)", "Stephen King (0.95)", "Roots (0.95)", "Chernobyl (0.95)", "Pillars of the Earth (0.85)", "Ken Follett (0.85)", "The Big Bang Theory (0.95)", "Netflix (0.95)", "Hulu (0.85)"], "categories_from_markup": ["Television miniseries", "Television genres", "Television series"], "categories_from_meta": [], "ner_candidates": ["The Stand\n", "Stephen King\n", "Roots\n", "Chernobyl\n", "Pillars of the Earth\n", "Ken Follett\n", "The Big Bang Theory\n", "Netflix\n", "Hulu\n", "Television miniseries\n", "Television genres\n", "Television series\n"], "ner_next_subjects": ["The Stand", "Roots", "Chernobyl", "Pillars of the Earth"]}

Pioneers such as [[Marie Curie (0.95)]], who was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and [[Ada Lovelace (0.90)]], recognized as the first computer programmer, paved the way for future generations. The portrayal of female scientists in popular media, including characters like [[Amy Farrah Fowler (0.92)]], played by [[Mayim Bialik (0.91)]], has helped to inspire interest in STEM among young women.\n\n== Current Representation ==\n\nToday, women represent a growing percentage of the STEM workforce, yet they remain underrepresented in many areas, particularly in engineering and computer science. According to recent statistics, women hold only about 28% of jobs in STEM fields in the United States. Organizations such as [[Society of Women Engineers (0.85)]] and [[Girls Who Code (0.88)]] are working to promote gender equality and support women in these fields. The impact of such organizations can be seen in initiatives aimed at mentoring young women and providing scholarships for STEM education.\n\n== Challenges Faced ==\n\nWomen in STEM continue to face various challenges, including gender bias, pay gaps, and work-life balance issues. The culture within many STEM workplaces can also be unwelcoming, leading to higher attrition rates among women. The character of [[Penny (The Big Bang Theory) (0.87)]], portrayed by [[Kaley Cuoco (0.90)]], illustrates the struggles of women balancing personal aspirations with societal expectations. Addressing these challenges is crucial for creating an inclusive environment that encourages women to pursue and thrive in STEM careers.\n\n== Impact of Media ==\n\nMedia representation plays a significant role in shaping perceptions of women in STEM. [[The Big Bang Theory]] has contributed to changing stereotypes by showcasing intelligent female characters who excel in scientific fields. The show's success has sparked discussions about the importance of diversity in STEM and has encouraged young women to pursue their interests in science and technology. By featuring strong female leads, the series has helped to normalize the presence of women in STEM roles.\n\n== Conclusion ==\n\nThe advancement of women in STEM is essential for fostering innovation and addressing global challenges. Continued efforts to promote gender equality, support educational initiatives, and challenge stereotypes are vital for encouraging women's participation in these fields. As seen through the lens of popular culture, such as in [[The Big Bang Theory]], there is potential for positive change and inspiration for future generations of women in STEM.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Women in STEM]]\n[[Category:Gender equality]]\n[[Category:Science and technology]]", "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "overall_confidence": null, "links_from_markup": ["The Big Bang Theory (TV series)", "Marie Curie (0.95)", "Ada Lovelace (0.90)", "Amy Farrah Fowler (0.92)", "Mayim Bialik (0.91)", "Society of Women Engineers (0.85)", "Girls Who Code (0.88)", "Penny (The Big Bang Theory) (0.87)", "Kaley Cuoco (0.90)", "The Big Bang Theory"], "categories_from_markup": ["Women in STEM", "Gender equality", "Science and technology"], "categories_from_meta": [], "ner_candidates": ["The Big Bang Theory (TV series)\n", "Marie Curie\n", "Ada Lovelace\n", "Amy Farrah Fowler\n", "Mayim Bialik\n", "Society of Women Engineers\n", "Girls Who Code\n", "Penny (The Big Bang Theory)\n", "Kaley Cuoco\n", "The Big Bang Theory\n", "Women in STEM\n", "Gender equality\n", "Science and technology\n"], "ner_next_subjects": ["Marie Curie", "Ada Lovelace", "Society of Women Engineers", "Girls Who Code"]}
