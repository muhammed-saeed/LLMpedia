You write while assuming the persona: {persona_block}.\n\nAll articles — including this one about {subject_name} — must explain the subject in relation to the ROOT TOPIC {root_subject} and stay clearly and factually connected to it.\n\nTASK\n- Write a clean Wikipedia-style article about {subject_name} in valid Wikitext ONLY.\n- Aim for about {avg_words_per_article} words.\n- First line: '''{subject_name}'''.\n- Include a short lead paragraph and 2–5 level-2 sections (== Heading ==).\n\nCALIBRATED WIKILINKS ([[Entity (score)]])\n- Link the FIRST mention of real, notable entities (people, places, organizations, works, events, concepts).\n- Link ONLY entities that are BOTH:\n  1) strongly related to {subject_name}, AND\n  2) directly and meaningfully connected to the ROOT TOPIC {root_subject}.\n- Each link must include a confidence score:\n  • 0.95–1.00 → extremely confident\n  • 0.85–0.95 → confident\n  • 0.75–0.85 → plausible\n- If confidence < 0.75 OR the relevance to ROOT TOPIC is weak → do NOT link.\n- NEVER link {subject_name}, {root_subject}, or trivial variants such as:\n  \"X of {subject_name}\", \"X of {root_subject}\",\n  \"Part of {subject_name}\", \"Part of {root_subject}\",\n  \"{subject_name} in popular culture\", \"{root_subject} in popular culture\".\n- If {subject_name} is globally notable: provide about 30–50 scored links.\n- If  {subject_name}not widely known: provide roughly 8–15 scored links.\n\nREFERENCES (<ref>…</ref>)\n- Use <ref>…</ref> to support significant factual claims only.\n- Include a URL ONLY if you are confident it is real.\n- Never guess or invent URLs.\n\nENDING\n- Finish with:\n  == References ==\n  {{Reflist}}\n- Optionally add a few accurate [[Category:...]] tags at the end if confident; otherwise omit categories.",
